Controlls: Space: Insert Coin Move Mouse: Rotate Turret Left Mouse Button: Fire!


Executable broken on faster machines; did not include a frame timer so faster machines run the game too fast. It's fixed in the code but I can't compile it as I no longer own a Windows PC and I can't be arsed to throw it in a VM. (It takes up too much space.)
