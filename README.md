Bitstream Panic

Game inspired by the game in TRON

Created By Sonic Waves TM (When I was still in gradeschool)


Controlls: Space: Insert Coin Move Mouse: Rotate Turret Left Mouse Button: Fire!


Executable broken on faster machines; did not include a frame timer so faster machines run the game too fast. It's fixed in the code but I can't compile it as I no longer own a Windows PC and I can't be arsed to throw it in a VM. (Windows takes up too much space.)

Built using Blitz3D v1.94. Compatibility with other versions is untested and not supported. It will not work with BlitzBasic, BlitzPlus, BlitzMax, or Max3D.
